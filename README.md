# es-shard-cleaner
Safely delete all indices with unassigned shards in a secure Elasticsearch environment using HTTPS and Basic Auth, without requiring SSL certificates.

## üö® Problem Statement

Your Elasticsearch cluster shows **red health status** due to many unassigned shards, causing search failures and degraded performance. You see errors like:

org.elasticsearch.action.search.SearchPhaseExecutionException:
Search rejected due to missing shards [[metrics-endpoint.metadata_current_default][0]]

Edit

Cluster stats may show:

```json
"status": "red",
"unassigned_shards": 696,
"active_shards_percent_as_number": 30.0
This means shards are unassigned because of corrupted indices, node failures, or misconfiguration.

üéØ Goal
Automatically find and delete all Elasticsearch indices with unassigned shards, restoring cluster health ‚Äî without requiring SSL certificates.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Queries Elasticsearch for indices with unassigned shards.

Lists those indices for your confirmation.

Deletes the listed indices permanently upon confirmation.

üìã Prerequisites
Elasticsearch accessible via HTTPS

Credentials with permissions to delete indices

Bash shell with curl and awk

Understanding that deleted indices cannot be recovered

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
1. Save the script as delete_unassigned_indices.sh
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# === CONFIGURATION ===
ES_HOST="https://172.16.202.122:9200"     # Your Elasticsearch URL
ES_USER="elastic"                         # Username with delete access
ES_PASS="123456"                          # Password
# ======================

# Test connection
if ! curl -s -k -u "$ES_USER:$ES_PASS" "$ES_HOST" > /dev/null; then
  echo "[x] Could not connect to Elasticsearch at $ES_HOST"
  exit 1
fi

# Find indices with unassigned shards
echo "[*] Looking for unassigned shards..."
indices=$(curl -s -k -u "$ES_USER:$ES_PASS" "$ES_HOST/_cat/shards?h=index,state" \
  | awk '$2 == "UNASSIGNED" {print $1}' \
  | sort -u)

if [[ -z "$indices" ]]; then
  echo "[‚úì] No unassigned shards found. Cluster is clean."
  exit 0
fi

echo "[!] These indices have unassigned shards and may be corrupted:"
echo "$indices" | sed 's/^/ - /'

read -p "Type 'yes' to delete them permanently: " confirm
if [[ "$confirm" != "yes" ]]; then
  echo "[x] Aborting deletion."
  exit 1
fi

for index in $indices; do
  echo "[*] Deleting: $index"
  response=$(curl -s -k -X DELETE -u "$ES_USER:$ES_PASS" "$ES_HOST/$index")
  if echo "$response" | grep -q '"acknowledged":true'; then
    echo "[‚úì] Deleted $index"
  else
    echo "[!] Failed to delete $index ‚Äî response: $response"
  fi
done

echo "[‚úì] Done. Check cluster health with:"
echo "curl -s -k -u $ES_USER:$ES_PASS $ES_HOST/_cluster/health?pretty"
2. Make the script executable:
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x delete_unassigned_indices.sh
3. Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
./delete_unassigned_indices.sh
4. Confirm deletion by typing yes when prompted.
5. Check cluster health:
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -s -k -u elastic:123456 https://172.16.202.122:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
The script permanently deletes indices with unassigned shards.

Always backup important data before running.

Use carefully in production environments.

Consider Elasticsearch‚Äôs Index Lifecycle Management for automated index handling.
